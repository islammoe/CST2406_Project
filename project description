Company Discerption: Katzs
 Katz’s located in Ludlow Street in New York’s Lower East Side have cultivated their business into a thriving, five-star establishment of fine dining. What started out as a small café with handwritten orders and a small staff quickly blossomed into a much larger organization and as word spread the demand for the exquisite menu items increased. Katz’s soon realized that they would need to expand into a larger establishment and hire additional cooks, wait staff, and other employees in order to properly handle the growing customer base. Also, as a newly recognized five-star restaurant, the team felt that a specialized computer system could help enhance the overall dining experience. Katz’s decided that in order to continue being effective, a new computer system would need to be integrated into their business. The team decided that they would like a system that would allow wait staff to place orders on a touch-screen located at each table. As each order is placed, it is separated and sent to the kitchen and the bar where the food and drink can be processed quickly. The system would automatically time-stamp the order and place the corresponding table number on the screen as well so that meals do not get mixed up. The system would also provide customers with current bill information based on what has been ordered. The next few years will bring a lot of changes to Katz’s. After the renovation has been completed, Katz’s will increase the staff by 30%, hiring additional cooks, servers, and dishwashing staff to ensure the best care of our guests. The larger staff will also allow Katz’s to extend our hours of business and therefore provide more service for our ever-growing waiting list. The combined increase in staff and hours will allow us for room to serve more guests and increase revenue by 40%. Finally, Katz’s will be introducing a new computer system that will allow for all of these changes to run as smoothly as possible. The new computer system will be much more reliable and timely compared to the older system that often caused confusion and errors. The entire Katz’s team is committed to working together to ensure all of these goals and objectives are met by the end of the financial year.
