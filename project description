Company Discerption: Katzs

 Katz’s located in Ludlow Street in New York’s Lower East Side have cultivated their business into a thriving, five-star establishment of fine dining. What started out as a small café with handwritten orders and a small staff quickly blossomed into a much larger organization and as word spread the demand for the exquisite menu items increased. Katz’s soon realized that they would need to expand into a larger establishment and hire additional cooks, wait staff, and other employees in order to properly handle the growing customer base. Also, as a newly recognized five-star restaurant, the team felt that a specialized computer system could help enhance the overall dining experience. Katz’s decided that in order to continue being effective, a new computer system would need to be integrated into their business. The team decided that they would like a system that would allow wait staff to place orders on a touch-screen located at each table. As each order is placed, it is separated and sent to the kitchen and the bar where the food and drink can be processed quickly. The system would automatically time-stamp the order and place the corresponding table number on the screen as well so that meals do not get mixed up. The system would also provide customers with current bill information based on what has been ordered. The next few years will bring a lot of changes to Katz’s. After the renovation has been completed, Katz’s will increase the staff by 30%, hiring additional cooks, servers, and dishwashing staff to ensure the best care of our guests. The larger staff will also allow Katz’s to extend our hours of business and therefore provide more service for our ever-growing waiting list. The combined increase in staff and hours will allow us for room to serve more guests and increase revenue by 40%. Finally, Katz’s will be introducing a new computer system that will allow for all of these changes to run as smoothly as possible. The new computer system will be much more reliable and timely compared to the older system that often caused confusion and errors. The entire Katz’s team is committed to working together to ensure all of these goals and objectives are met by the end of the financial year.

 - Data entry

Functional Requirements Specification:

-Stakeholders
The following are the stakeholders in the application. They have a vested interest of
some sort in the way that the application works. It is important to them that the
application is easy to use.
• Owner of the restaurant
• Employees (Manager, Host, Waiters, Busboy, and Cook)
• Programmers

Nonfunctional Requirements:

Usability:
The system’s user interface will be very simple and self-explanatory. The manager and the cook will interact with the system through touch-screen LCDs. They are very easy to adapt to and use. The users just have to touch the option they want. The waiters will interact with PDAs. They will each be able to access the tables that they are responsible for. The menus for the restaurant will show up as drop-down menus on the PDAs. The waiters only have to select the item that the customer ordered from the drop-down list.

Reliability:
The system is guaranteed to be reliable. All inputs to the system will be selections from options that the system will show on the screen. Since the system will only provide valid options, there is absolutely no possibility that invalid inputs can be entered. Each user will have a unique username and password. This removes the risk of unauthorized access to the system. Also, users can only access parts of the system that they require for their job. For example, a waiter cannot access the inventory management or the payroll feature of the system. Those parts among a few others can only be accessed by the manager. All these constraints will ensure the reliability of the system. 

Performance: 
The system will be used by many employees of the restaurant at the same time and can handle it without any errors. However, for this to happen, the server at the restaurant should be able to handle all the traffic without creating any problems. The restaurant should also have a high-speed wireless connection for the system to perform its best. The waiters will be using PDAs and will only be able to connect to the system with a wireless connection. Since some tasks like placing and cooking and an order are sequential, the
waiter has to update the system with the order first before the cook will see it. In order to for this to happen efficiently, the internet connection needs to be fast so that changes are reflected on the website instantly without any delay.

Supportability:
The system will support changes that the restaurant might need to make in future. The manager will have the ability to modify items from the menu. He will also be able to add or delete users to the system for layoffs, retirements or new hires.
