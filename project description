A system that would allow wait staff to place orders on a touch-screen located at each table. As each order is placed, it is separated and sent to the kitchen and the bar where the food and drink can be processed quickly. The system would automatically time-stamp the order and place the corresponding table number on the screen as well so that meals do not get mixed up. The system would also provide customers with current bill information based on what has been ordered
